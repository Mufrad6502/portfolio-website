## Content Management

All content is managed through JSON files in the `src/data/` directory:

### Personal Information (`src/data/portfolio-data.json`)

Update your personal details, contact information, experience, skills, and more:

\`\`\`json
{
  "personal": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "title": "Your Title",

Add or modify your projects:

\`\`\`typescript
{
  id: 1,
  slug: "project-slug",
  title: "Project Title",
  category: "Project Category",
  description: ["Project description paragraphs..."],
  technologies: ["React", "TypeScript", "etc"],
  coverImage: "/path/to/cover.jpg",
  liveUrl: "https://project-url.com"
}
\`\`\`

## Customization

### Colors and Theme

Modify the color scheme in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/index.css`:

:root {
  --primary: 186 100% 50%; /* Cyan */
  --secondary: 240 5% 10%; /* Dark gray */
  /* Add more custom colors */
}
\`\`\`

### Animations

Customize animation settings through the Animation Context or disable them entirely:

\`\`\`typescript
// In src/contexts/animation-context.tsx
const defaultSettings = {
  duration: 700,
  delay: 100,
  easing: "ease-out",
  intensity: 0.5,
  enabled: true
}
\`\`\`

### Components

All components are in `src/components/` and can be customized:

- `src/components/ui/` - Base UI components
- `src/components/` - Page-specific components

## Building for Production

\`\`\`bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
\`\`\`

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

# Portfolio Website with JSON Content Management

This portfolio website is designed to be easily customizable through a JSON data file. This allows you to update your content without having to modify the codebase directly.

## How to Update Content

All content is stored in the `data/portfolio-data.json` file. You can edit this file to update the information displayed on your portfolio website.

### Structure of the JSON File

The JSON file is organized into several sections:

1. **Meta**: Contains metadata about the website, such as the title and description.
2. **Personal**: Contains personal information like name, title, location, contact details, and social media links.
3. **About**: Contains information about yourself, including bio, professional focus, languages, and interests.
4. **Navigation**: Contains the navigation menu items.
5. **Experience**: Contains your work experience details.
6. **Credentials**: Contains your certifications, education, and skills.
7. **Technical Skills**: Contains your technical skills categorized by type.

## Adding Images

To add or update images:

1. Place your image files in the `public` directory.
2. Update the paths in the JSON file to point to your new images.

## Projects

Projects are managed separately in the `lib/projects.ts` file. You can update this file to add, remove, or modify projects.

## Development

To run the development server:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
\`\`\`

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.

This refactoring allows users to update all content through the JSON file without modifying the codebase. The components now dynamically read from this data source, making content updates easier and more manageable.
